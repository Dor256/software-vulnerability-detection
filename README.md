# Project - Software Vulnerability Detection
This project creates, and uses, a model for vulnerability detection in javascript files.

## How to run this project

### To train the model -
1. Install python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Inside this directory, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, this will download all python dependencies to your machine
3. Inside this directory, run `python3 train_model.py`, the program will train the model, and then display the different graphs explained in the project.
4. The output is saved in the `models` folder

### To test a specific sample -
1. Install docker from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Inside the project, run `docker build . -t project` to build the docker image for this project
3. Execute `docker run -p 3000:3000 project`, this will allow you to access the static analysis server via `localhost:3000`
4. Inside the project, run `python3 test-sample.py`, this will send the code inside `sample-js-function.js` and evaluate it using the model, returning the prediction for this file.
